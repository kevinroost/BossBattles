# __BOSS BATTLES__

SCREENSHOTS GO HERE


Boss Battles is a text based battle simulator that pits players against 5 different enemies, gathering loot along the way. After the player chooses one of three classes, each with unique starting stats, they come face-to-face with their first opponent. Once defeated, the boss drops 3 pieces of equipment that the player will choose from. Each piece of equipment will boost certain stats upon pick-up, setting up the player for the next battle. Victory comes when all 5 bosses are defeated!
